Hi friends!

DummyLib is a little personal project of mine. It is essentially attempts at recreating various Python methods in very bad ways!

A couple of notes:
  1. Anything included in here is not guarenteed to work
  2. I am decently new to Python with only slightly more experience with programming overall
  3. If there is a "bug" with something, there is a decent chance I chose not to fix it in order to maintain the name "Dummy"!
  4. Various tools of an Artifical Intelligence nature were used for a couple of the math methods, which are listed. Those I do not claim as my own as I have little clue as to how they work

To use this use git clone. I do not know what a git clone is though so you get to figure it out! :)

Have fun!
